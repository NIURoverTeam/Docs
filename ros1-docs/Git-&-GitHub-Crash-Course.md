## Quick Introduction

**Git** is *version control* software.  With many people working on software simultaneously, version control is very important.  It allows us to:
* Edit a file someone else is editing. (git uses a "diff" to see what you changed, and merge it with other changes.)
* Look back at old code.
* Create branches to test things, and revert back if you change your mind.

It's a very powerful piece of software, and learning to use it helps the whole team work together.
