## "The Tower": Wireless Access Point for the Base Station ("Shatterdome")
As a prerequisite to getting the antennas working, some of the computers need to be assigned manual IP addresses.  We decided that, in the interest of maintaining internet access, a wireless access point would assign special addresses while maintaining traditional DHCP.
### Method
The current router is the "ASUS AC750", located in the CS cabinet.

[From memory, a longer instruction portion pending.]

The router has been set up to use DHCP.  The DHCP page also allows a list of exceptions in the form of MAC addresses.  Devices with MAC addresses in the table will be assigned the specific address entered on the exception page. So, it is treated like a dynamic IP address by the computer/device, leaving internet access when switching networks unaffected.
