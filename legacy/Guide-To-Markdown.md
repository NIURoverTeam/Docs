## Quick Introduction

**Markdown** is the *markup language* we use to style
text on GitHub.

It's useful for making easy
to read documentation without much effort.  You can use it to `insert_a_line_of_code();` in the
middle of a sentence, and also to have:
```javascript
/*
 * A block of code that sits on its own with syntax highlighting!
 */
function helloWorld() {
   document.write("Hello, World!");
}
```
As a matter of preference, I would recommend relegating the use of **bolding** and *italics* to important or key words.
